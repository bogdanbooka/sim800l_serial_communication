# sim800l_serial_communication
Hi.
I tried to make a simple gadget for watering my remote garden on SMS.

I have bought Arduino Uno Rev.3, Sim800L module and couple of relays.

Sim800L module RX/TX are connected to 8/7 Arduino pins.

Relays are negative - it means that they are swithching on by Arduino LOW digital signal.

They are connected to 6/9 Arduino pins.

First relay is switching on first water pump.
Second relay is switching on second water pump.

Here is a sample for this gadget.
